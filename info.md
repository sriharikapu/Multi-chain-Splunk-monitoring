Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
It is now easy to spin up devnets (PoW and/or PoA) with fully integrated analytics across chains with Splunk. All the logs, metrics, and even ledger data are automatically indexed into a local Splunk deployment. This enables devs to achieve 4 levels of Operational Intelligence: search and investigate issues with Dapps and/or infrastructure, become proactive by monitoring and alerting, break down silos and gain operational visibility across chains, finally get real-time business insights by combining on-chain and off-chain data.
